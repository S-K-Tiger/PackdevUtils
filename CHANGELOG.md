# v1.4.1 -- 7/29/21

* Added language scopes for snippets to prevent them from showing up in unnecessary contexts. Unfortunately, the "necessary context" for the universal registry is pretty broad, but the other helper snippets should be cleanly out of the way now.

# v1.4.0 -- 7/28/21

* Added @kubejs/shaped/ helper snippets for common recipe shapes: Chest, Compression. More like these planned.
* Added Mystic Alchemy utility snippet for potion ingredient recipe, @mysticalchemy/recipe/potion_ingredient. Added @kubejs/mysticalchemy/potion_ingredient to create a reusable helper function for simple recipes of this type. 
* Added Resourceful Bees utility snippets for custom bee, honey, and bee trait definition. Use @resourcefulbees/custom to get started.
* Added Resourceful Bees centrifuge recipe. Use @resourcefulbees/recipe/centrifuge.
