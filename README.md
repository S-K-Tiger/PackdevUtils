# PackdevUtils

Tools to help with Minecraft modpack development in 1.16.5 (currently).

## Contents

Snippets -- Snippet files that support auto-complete for both vanilla and modded resources, such as block and entity IDs. More to come. The correct syntax for invoking a snippet is ``@<modID>/``. You'll then see options such as ``@minecraft/blocks/`` or ``@minecraft/entities/`` to allow you to select the correct auto-complete list.

For a list of currently supported mods, please see [the project&#39;s wiki](https://github.com/WACriminalG2/PackdevUtils/wiki/Universal-Registry).
