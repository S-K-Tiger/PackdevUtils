## Contents

VSCode Snippets -- Snippet files for VScode that support auto-complete for both vanilla and modded resources, such as block and entity IDs, and common scripting syntax for Open Terrain Generator. More to come. The correct syntax for invoking a snippet is ``@<modID>/``. You'll then see options such as ``@minecraft/blocks/`` or ``@minecraft/entities/`` to allow you to select the correct auto-complete list.

### Open Terrain Generator

[CustomHeightControl Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dSklabHyzcGs6Q6xZoG-X24nCHNKlnoJ_WUBMqP7ans/edit?usp=sharing) -- A Google Sheets template for working with Open Terrain Generator CHC values. Editing is not enabled; copy it to your own account before use.

TreeO3s -- A directory of tree BO3s with interesting or useful shapes, intended to be used as templates for Open Terrain Generator objects. Most of these are the result of modded saplings, and credit is given within the BO3 to the original mod.
